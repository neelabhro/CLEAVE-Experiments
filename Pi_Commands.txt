#Check the temperature of the Pi. Maintain the temperature below 80'C.
1. /opt/vc/bin/vcgencmd measure_temp

#Check the respective CPU Frequencies
1. Current Frequency: sudo cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/cpuinfo_cur_freq
2. Minimum Frequency: sudo cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/cpuinfo_min_freq
3. Maximum Frequency: sudo cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/cpuinfo_max_freq

#To overclock your Pi 4:
1. sudo nano /boot/config.txt
2. #uncomment to overclock the arm. 700 MHz is
the default.
over_voltage=2
arm_freq=1750
#(CPU/GPU core voltage adjustment. The value should be in the range [-16, 8] which equates to the range [0.8V, 1.4V] with 0.025V steps. In other words, specifying -16 will give 0.8V as the GPU/core voltage, and specifying 8 will give 1.4V. For defaults see table below.)
2. #uncomment to overclock the arm. 700 MHz is
the default.
over_voltage=6
arm_freq=2147
gpu_freq=750
#(This is the maximum overclocking limit possible in Raspberry Pi 4b)
3. sudo reboot
4. Monitor frequency using:
watch -n 1 vcgencmd measure_clock arm   OR    sudo cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/cpuinfo_cur_freq


To lock the CPU to the max set frequency even when idle, use:
1. force_turbo=1


sudo cpupower frequency-set -g performance
