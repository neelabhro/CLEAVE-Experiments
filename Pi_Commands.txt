#Check the temperature of the Pi. Maintain the temperature below 80'C.
1. /opt/vc/bin/vcgencmd measure_temp

#Check the respective CPU Frequencies
1. Current Frequency: sudo cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/cpuinfo_cur_freq
2. Minimum Frequency: sudo cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/cpuinfo_min_freq
3. Maximum Frequency: sudo cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/cpuinfo_max_freq

#To overclock your Pi 4:
1. sudo nano /boot/config.txt
2. #uncomment to overclock the arm. 700 MHz is
the default.
over_voltage=2
arm_freq=1750
#(he over_voltage command adjusts the core CPU/GPU voltage, and accepts figures between -16 and 8. The default value is 0.
A faster CPU speed demands higher voltage and, if Raspberry Pi doesnâ€™t get enough volts, you will see a small lightning bolt appearing in the top right of the window,  this point, the CPU will be reduced to the 700MHz default speed)
3. sudo reboot
4. Monitor frequency using:
watch -n 1 vcgencmd measure_clock arm   OR    sudo cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/cpuinfo_cur_freq
